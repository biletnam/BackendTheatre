Project Description
This is the first of many small projects.

The coder I choose for this first job will get a chance to take on all the other projects. We will try to do once project a week till we have a finished product.

Phase 1

Using the code that I purchased I would like to take some of these features to add to our admin.php

The code that I purchased you can view at http://theatrescript.space/ and you can search for titles via the search bar and it will add the items to that DB. I will give you access this code to use as a reference.


On this admin page I need the following.

We need a add movie page where there will be search form that will allow you to search for the movie.

Once the movie is found I need a ADD TO SCREEN button where we have to select a screen #.

We need a website options page where we can choose how many screens we have from a drop down menu that ranges from 1-30. We will need to save this option before it is set to the database and if the page is loaded it will need to reflect the current setting.

We need a current movies page where it will list the screen count from the above page and each screen will list the current movie for that screen. 

When you click on one of these titles it will need to display the following info that will need to be stored in our db.


Title - Year 

Movie Poster:

Plot:

Story: N/A

Did you know:  N/A GOT IT

Release Date:

User Votes: tomato

Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/embed?listType=search&list=MOVIETITLE+Trailer

As seen in the following page. http://theatrescript.space/movie/1/Furious+Seven



6. On the current movies page there needs to be a way to edit times for each title.
We need the ability to add up to 10 play times for each title.

7. we need a main index.php page that will display the posters and titles for all of our current movies. Will need to have the screen # and the times for each show. If a user clicks the title or the poster we need to display all the movies info like the above link including the trailer.

also on the main index we need to display some info scraped from rotten tomatoes.
